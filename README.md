## 🧠 How it Works

- Monitors running processes using [`psutil`](https://pypi.org/project/psutil/)
- Disables Sticky Keys by updating this registry key:

  ```
  HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Control Panel\Accessibility\StickyKeys\Flags
  ```

- Automatically restores original registry setting after game closes
